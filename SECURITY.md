## Terms of Service

WhatsApp, like many other platforms, has Terms of Service that users are expected to adhere to. Using unofficial APIs may violate these terms, potentially resulting in penalties such as being banned from the platform.

## Stability and Reliability

Unofficial APIs can be subject to changes or discontinuation by the service provider without notice. This could lead to your application breaking unexpectedly or becoming non-functional.

## Security

Unofficial APIs may not undergo the same level of scrutiny and security testing as official APIs. This could potentially expose your application and its users to security vulnerabilities.

## Legal Implications

Depending on your jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of your application, there may be legal implications to consider when using unofficial APIs, such as intellectual property rights or terms of service violations.

## Disclaimer

The author of this repository cannot be held responsible for any misuse or violation of terms of service that may occur through the use of this software. While efforts have been made to create a functional and reliable application, it is important to note that the use of unofficial APIs, such as the Whatsmeow WhatsApp API, may potentially violate the terms of service of the corresponding platform, in this case, WhatsApp. Users are advised to exercise caution and use this software responsibly. By using this software, you acknowledge and accept the risks involved and agree to use it in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.


# ---

Given these considerations, it's essential to weigh the benefits of using unofficial APIs against the potential risks and consequences. If you decide to proceed with your application, make sure to communicate clearly with your users about the limitations and risks involved. Additionally, stay informed about any updates or changes to the unofficial API you're using, and be prepared to adapt your application accordingly.
